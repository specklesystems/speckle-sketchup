# The purpose of this file is customizing environment of the developer on SketchUp.
# Each developer can customize it's own loader(this file), by this way developer can load their helper tools
# and helper methods ONLY in dev mode.

# Change the base folder and copy this file to Sketchup Plugins directory
# If you need to test in several versions of SketchUp, create symlinks to this file
# ( AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp <version>\SketchUp\Plugins )
# Create a link to Plugins folder with this command
